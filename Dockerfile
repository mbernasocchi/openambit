#  Recommended way to build the container this creates (for lack of
#  an easy way to exclude everything but the Dockerfile):
#
#    docker build -t openambit:jessie - < Dockerfile
#
#  After that is just a matter of compiling the sources with:
#
#    docker run -v $PWD:/code openambit:jessie
#
#  once you've removed any existing *-build directories.  In order
#  to set BUILD_EXTRAS and pass arguments on to `cmake` that becomes
#  something like:
#
#    docker run -v $PWD:/code --env BUILD_EXTRAS=1 openambit:jessie \
#      ./build.sh -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
#
#  Doing so gives you a basic sanity check of code compilablity in a
#  minimalistic, reproducible development platform.
